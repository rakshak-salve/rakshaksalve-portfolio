💻 Rakshak Salve | Engineering Portfolio 2026
High-Performance Brutalist Showcase built with React 19 & Vite
This repository houses my professional portfolio, designed to showcase my journey as a 2025 B.Tech AI Graduate and Java Backend Engineer. It is built with a focus on performance, modularity, and a stark "Brutalist" aesthetic that mirrors my philosophy of transparent and efficient logic.

🚀 Key Architectural Features
Lazy Loading & Suspense: Implemented code-splitting for heavy components (Heatmaps/Stats) to ensure initial load times under 1.5s.

Custom Hooks: Developed useDecodeText to provide high-end, interactive UI elements without sacrificing performance.

Dynamic Logic Sync: Real-time integration with LeetCode and GitHub APIs to display live coding heatmaps and contribution grids.

Responsive Brutalism: A mobile-first, high-contrast design system built using Tailwind CSS for consistent performance across all devices.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Dependencies
Framework: React 19 (Latest)

Build Tool: Vite v7.3.1 (Optimized for speed)

Styling: Tailwind CSS (Utility-first architecture)

Visual Proof: github-calendar and custom SVG API integrations for LeetCode performance metrics.
