### High-Performance Brutalist Showcase built with React 19 & Vite

This repository houses my professional portfolio, designed to showcase my journey as a **2025 B.Tech AI Graduate** and **Java Backend Engineer**. It is built with a focus on performance, modularity, and a stark "Brutalist" aesthetic that mirrors my philosophy of transparent and efficient logic.



## 🚀 Key Architectural Features
* **Lazy Loading & Suspense**: Implemented code-splitting for heavy components like **CodingHeatmaps** and **GithubStats** to ensure optimal initial load times.
* **Custom Hooks**: Developed `useDecodeText` to provide high-end, interactive UI elements for the **Hero** section without sacrificing performance.
* **Dynamic Logic Sync**: Real-time integration with **LeetCode** and **GitHub** APIs to display live coding heatmaps and contribution grids.
* **Responsive Brutalism**: A mobile-first, high-contrast design system built using **Tailwind CSS** for consistent performance across all devices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Dependencies
* **Framework**: **React 19** (Latest).
* **Build Tool**: **Vite v7.3.1** (Optimized for development speed and production performance).
* **Styling**: **Tailwind CSS** (Utility-first architecture).
* **Visual Proof**: Integration with custom SVG APIs for real-time **LeetCode** and **CodeChef** performance metrics.
